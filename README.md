Grav guy 3D
===========

A gravity guy game (kind of) in 3D. Uses WebGL with Three.js.

Current Features:
-----------------
* Gravity control with arrow keys.
* Time slow with 'S' key, press and hold to slow down time (No fuel recharging for now).
* Speed of player gets progressively higher (No cap for now, crashes after a long time due to incredible speed).
* Collision with walls, roof and floor.
* Walls warp (Infinitely long walls).
* Simple block static enemies spawn. Touch them to get yourself killed.
* Enemies that move linearly spawn.  
(That's about it for now)
